# GitTray

**GitTray** is a lightweight Windows tray utility that continuously monitors all Git repositories under selected directories and displays a small colored icon in the Windows system tray:

- üü¢ **Green** ‚Äì all repositories clean and up to date.
- üü° **Yellow** ‚Äì repositories with unpushed commits or without a remote.
- üî¥ **Red** ‚Äì repositories with uncommitted changes or that are behind/diverged from remote.

It‚Äôs ideal for developers managing multiple repositories across drives, ensuring that nothing remains uncommitted or unpushed.

## ‚ú® Features

- Scans multiple root directories for Git repositories.
- Detects and categorizes repositories as **Clean**, **Dirty**, **Ahead**, **Behind**, **Diverged**, or **No Upstream**.
- Updates every N seconds (default 60).
- Tray icon color reflects overall state.
- Tooltip shows quick summary.
- Left-click opens a list of problematic repos.
- Double-click a repo to open it in **Explorer**.
- Right-click tray icon ‚Üí manual rescan, edit configuration, or exit.

## üöÄ Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
- Windows 10 or 11
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- `git` in PATH

### 2. Clone and Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajlakanen/GitTray.git
cd GitTray
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```
Output executable will be at:
```
./bin/Release/net8.0-windows/win-x64/publish/GitTray.exe
```

### 3. Run
Launch `GitTray.exe`. It will appear as a small circle icon in the Windows system tray.

### 4. Configure
On first launch, a default config file is created at:
```
%LocalAppData%\GitTray\config.json
```

Example:
```json
{
  "roots": [
    "C:\\Users\\YOURNAME\\source",
    "D:\\repos"
  ],
  "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules", "bin\\*", "obj\\*"],
  "intervalSeconds": 60
}
```
- **roots** ‚Äì directories to recursively scan.
- **ignorePatterns** ‚Äì substrings or simple wildcards to skip.
- **intervalSeconds** ‚Äì refresh interval.

You can open this file anytime via right-click ‚Üí **Open config.json**.

## üß† How it Works
GitTray runs a background timer that executes:
- `git status --porcelain` ‚Üí checks for uncommitted changes.
- `git status -sb --porcelain=2 -b` ‚Üí inspects ahead/behind counts and upstream presence.

It aggregates all results and updates the tray icon color:
- **Green:** all repos clean and synced.
- **Yellow:** clean but ahead of remote or no remote.
- **Red:** dirty, behind, or diverged.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Autostart

To start GitTray automatically when you log in:
1. Press `Win + R` ‚Üí type `shell:startup` ‚Üí press Enter.
2. Copy a shortcut to `GitTray.exe` into that folder.

## üß™ Development Notes

- Built using **WinForms** on .NET 8 (WindowsDesktop SDK).
- Uses only standard libraries ‚Äî no dependencies.
- Thread-safe async git status checks via `Task.WhenAll`.
- Designed for minimal memory footprint.

## üí° Future Ideas

- Optional notifications when repos become dirty.
- Support for `git fetch` to detect remote changes.
- Integration with GitHub Desktop or Visual Studio.
- Dark/light tray icon themes.
